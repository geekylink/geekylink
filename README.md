### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Maybe someday you will find useful projects on this page, but today is not that day.

I travel a lot, I write code all around the world. Currently writing code for the 21st century, basically from just outside an Amish community, because I live a weird life. Most of my work is private, but I have uploaded some of my old projects including games and my really old game hacking website from 2008 (Essh, long time ago). Hope you enjoy.
