### Welcome to my GitHub 👋

🧑‍💻 About Me:

I'm a seasoned developer with a passion for coding and exploring and experiencing different corners of the world, my coding journey has taken me far and wide! 🌍 

🚀 Quick facts about me:

🛠️ I'm a polyglot programmer, proficient in multiple languages and paradigms having worked at both major corporations and small startups.

🌏  Well-versed with and shaped by different work cultures and habits from studying, teaching, and developing abroad.

🔭 I always enjoy enriching myself with a variety of topics outside IT, as I believe it helps me broaden my skills and understanding. One of my major non-software projects is an aquaponics system I developed that can grow several hundred fish and provide me enough fresh greens to have have fresh lettuce every day even in the middle of the cold northern winters.

👥 I readily share my knowledge, and am ready to learn from anyone down to take this ride with me.
